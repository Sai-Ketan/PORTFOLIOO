            <p>
              I'm a designer passionate about creating visual experiences that connect with people.
              My journey began with content creation, where I developed an eye for storytelling and
              audience engagement.
            </p>
            <p>
              This foundation naturally evolved into UI/UX design, where I now focus on crafting
              intuitive interfaces and compelling visual identities. Whether it's motion graphics,
              web design, or brand visuals, I approach each project with attention to detail and
              a commitment to meaningful design.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science at B.V. Raju Institute of Technology, I'm constantly
              exploring new tools and techniques to push creative boundaries and deliver
              production-ready work.
